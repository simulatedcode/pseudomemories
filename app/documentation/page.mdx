# Pseudo Memories
## Project Vision & Summary

**Pseudo Memories** is an immersive digital experience designed as a professional artist portfolio that reaches for the highest standards of creative coding and web aesthetics. The project name suggests a bridge between the digital and the organic—an exploration of "simulated memories" through high-fidelity visuals, ambient audio, and interactive storytelling.

## Core Mission

The mission is to curate a space where technology and art converge seamlessly. It aims to:
- **Elevate Digital Presence**: Achieving "Awwwards-level" quality through meticulous typography, motion design, and responsive layouts.
- **Evoke Atmosphere**: Using real-time solar data and geolocation to root the digital experience in the user's physical world.
- **Synthesize Experience**: Combining specialized 3D renderings (Three.js) with smooth parallax scrolling and reactive audio systems.

## Technical Architecture

Our system architecture is built on a modern, high-performance stack:

- **Core Framework**: `Next.js 15+` (App Router) for robust routing and server-side optimization.
- **Rendering Engine**: `Three.js` (R160) via `@react-three/fiber` for cinematic 3D environments.
- **Motion & Physics**: `Framer Motion 12` for fluid transitions and micro-interactions.
- **Styling Layer**: `TailwindCSS v4` for a minimal, utility-first design system.
- **Sensor Integration**: IP-based solar calculations and system performance metrics (Memory/GPU) for real-time interactivity.

## Active Protocols

Status: **Online**
Version: **2026.02.10**
Reference: **[SYSTEM_NOMINAL]**

All systems within the Pseudo Memories environment are designed to be reactive. From the mouse-responsive starfields to the dynamically generated audio waveforms, every element serves the goal of creating a "living" digital artifact.
