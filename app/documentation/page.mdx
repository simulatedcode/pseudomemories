# Pseudo Memories
## Project Vision & Summary

**Pseudo Memories** is an immersive digital experience designed as a professional artist portfolio that reaches for the highest standards of creative coding and web aesthetics. The project name suggests a bridge between the digital and the organic—an exploration of "Pseudo Memories" through high-fidelity visuals, ambient audio, and interactive storytelling.

## Core Mission

The mission is to curate a space where technology and art converge seamlessly. It aims to:
- **Elevate Digital Presence**: Achieving "Awwwards-level" quality through meticulous typography, motion design, and responsive layouts.
- **Evoke Atmosphere**: Using real-time solar data and geolocation to root the digital experience in the user's physical world.
- **Synthesize Experience**: Combining specialized 3D renderings (Three.js) with smooth parallax scrolling and reactive audio systems.

## Technical Architecture

Our system architecture is built on a modern, high-performance stack:

- **Core Framework**: `Next.js 15+` (App Router) for robust routing and server-side optimization.
- **Rendering Engine**: `Three.js` (R160) via `@react-three/fiber` for cinematic 3D environments.
- **Motion & Physics**: `Framer Motion 12` for fluid transitions and micro-interactions.
- **Styling Layer**: `TailwindCSS v4` for a minimal, utility-first design system.
- **Sensor Integration**: IP-based solar calculations and system performance metrics (Memory/GPU) for real-time interactivity.

## Featured Sketches

A selection of fragmented memories reconstructed through various digital and artistic mediums:

| Project | Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ohm** | Ethereal Sketch | A spiritual ascent captured in charcoal, exploring the boundary between the physical and the infinite. |
| **stay unknow Nº.5** | Minimalist Line | Raw, unrefined strokes mapping the silent majesty of peaks that refuse to be fully known. |
| **Panorama** | Screen printing | A rhythmic layering of ocean blues and atmospheric clouds, frozen in a moment of perpetual stillness. |
| **Shine on** | Graphite Terrain | Detailed geological textures documenting the slow, tectonic shifts of a memory being reconstructed. |
| **Landscape Nº.2** | Framed Void | A reductive landscape study where the horizon is merely a suggestion within a digital blue frame. |
| **Where are you** | Fragmentary Form | A solitary object standing in a minimalist expanse, questioning its own presence in a fading reality. |
| **Stay Unknow Nº.2** | Shadow Works | A lonely silhouette traversing a vibrant pink void, leaving behind nothing but a long, dark memory. |
| **Cobalt Nº.1** | Blue Synthesis | Exploring the chaotic beauty of fluid dynamics and cellular expansion in a hyper-saturated cobalt field. |

## Active Protocols

Status: **Online**
Version: **2026.02.11**
Reference: **[SYSTEM_NOMINAL]**

All systems within the Pseudo Memories environment are designed to be reactive. From the mouse-responsive starfields to the dynamically generated audio waveforms, every element serves the goal of creating a "living" digital artifact.
